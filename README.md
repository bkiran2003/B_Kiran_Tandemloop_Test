# Tandemloop Screening Test - B Kiran

This repository contains the solutions for the **Stage-1 Screening Test** for the Full Stack Developer position at Tandemloop.

**Author:** B Kiran
**Language:** Java
**IDE Used:** [Name of your IDE, e.g., IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code]

## Project Structure

The solutions are implemented in Java, with each problem contained in its own file as per the instructions:

* **`Problem_1.java`**: A calculator application using a class structure to perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* **`Problem_2.java`**: Generates a series of odd numbers based on the input count ($a$).
* **`Problem_3.java`**: Generates a series of odd numbers up to a maximum input value ($a$).
* **`Problem_4.java`**: Analyzes a list of integers to count multiples of numbers 1 through 9 using a `HashMap`.

## Usage Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in any Java-compatible IDE.
3.  Run each file individually to verify the output.
4.  Input can be provided via the console as prompted.

## Notes

* Standard Java libraries were used for input handling (`Scanner`) and data structures (`HashMap`, `ArrayList`).
* The code follows the logic examples provided in the problem statement.
* Exception handling is included for division operations in Problem 1.
