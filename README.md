# 🚀 Tandemloop Screening Test - Solutions


Welcome! This repository contains the source code for the **Stage-1 Screening Test** for the Full Stack Developer position at **Tandemloop**.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The solutions are implemented in **Java**, with each problem isolated in its own file for clarity and modularity.

| File Name | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Problem_1.java`** | 🧮 **Calculator Class**<br>Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using a class-based structure. | OOP / Logic |
| **`Problem_2.java`** | 🔢 **Odd Series (By Count)**<br>Generates a series of odd numbers based on the *count* of terms input ($a$). | Loop Logic |
| **`Problem_3.java`** | 📈 **Odd Series (By Max Value)**<br>Generates a series of odd numbers up to a specific *maximum value* ($a$). | Loop Logic |
| **`Problem_4.java`** | 📊 **Multiples Analysis**<br>Analyzes a dataset to count multiples of numbers 1-9 using a `HashMap`. | Data Structures |

## 📌 Implementation Notes

* **Zero Dependencies:** The solutions use standard Java libraries only. No external assistance or frameworks were used.
* **Error Handling:** `Problem_1` includes exception handling for division by zero.
* **Logic:** The series generation logic in `Problem_3` adapts based on whether the input is even or odd, preserving the pattern requested in the problem statement.
